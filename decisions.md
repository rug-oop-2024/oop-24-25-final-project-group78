1. Private attributes & methods for encapsulation reasons (what should be accessed from outside was left as public)
2. The code is well docmented by including docstrings and comments
3. There are some commented out lines: some of them because of a change in approach (not using them anymore); the others, because of flake8 reasons (for example, some imports were not used in the code)
